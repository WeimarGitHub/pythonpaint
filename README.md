# PRGE (Python Raster Graphics Editor)
The Python Raster Graphics Editor is an in-development raster graphics editor that is free and open source, meaning anyone can view the source code. It is created solely on Python.

PRGE can run on any desktop environment, as long as it supports the IDLE Python Shell, Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code. It is also completely open source, and anyone can edit this program.
